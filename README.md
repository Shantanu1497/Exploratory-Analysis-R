# Exploratory-Analysis-R

In this exercise, I will explore a data set on red wine quality. The objective is to explore which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines. I’ll start by exploring the data using R. As interesting relationships in the data are discovered, I’ll produce and refine plots to illustrate them.
